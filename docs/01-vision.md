# Vision

**Tone:** Meme-parody of cockfighting starring Dolanverse ducks. Silly, punchy, watchable.
**Goal:** Quick, satisfying training decisions + fun auto-battle spectacles.
**Pillars:**
1. **Train with Personality:** Ducks have moods/quirks that matter.
2. **Auto-Fight Hype:** Sim-first for fairness; render makes it hilarious.
3. **Meaningful Retirement:** Breed for lineage or convert to Feed for upgrades.
