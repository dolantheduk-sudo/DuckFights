# Economy & Currencies (Authoritative)

> **Naming:**
> - Soft currency: **Dolamis**
> - Sacrifice currency: **Feed**
> - Premium: **Crystals**
> - Premium+: **Goldolamis**
> - Scout: **Ticket**

## 1) Currency Overview

- **Dolamis (Soft, per-career earned but meta-spent)**
  - **Sources:** Earned during a drake’s career (matches, quests, milestones).
  - **Sinks:** *None inside the career loop.* Coins are only spent **outside of careers** on upgrades that persist across all future careers.
  - **Meta Uses:** Training facility upgrades, unlocking new gyms/arenas, and other account-wide systems. Never used directly in fights or training inside a single career.
  - **Notes:** Keeps careers “pure” (no economy interference). Functions purely as meta-progression currency.

- **Feed (Sacrifice currency)**
  - **Sources:** Converting a career-finished drake to Feed.
  - **Sinks:** Permanent account/roster upgrades (training efficiency, facility unlocks), breeding odds boosters (non-stacking per session), rare utility unlocks (extra kennel slot).
  - **Notes:** Long-term power; primary retirement decision: **Breed vs Feed**.

- **Crystals**
  - **Sources:** IAP, rare milestones (e.g., season completion), limited events.
  - **Sinks:** Cosmetics, extra save/kennel slots, rename tokens, additional loadout pages, queue skips, cosmetic intros/VFX, **season pass (if separate from Premium+)**.
  - **Integrity Rule:** No direct stat boosts; may accelerate **time** (e.g., training speed tickets) if allowed by policy (see §6).

- **Goldolamis (higher-tier premium, paid only)**
  - **Sources:** IAP only (top-tier packs), rare IRL promos.
  - **Sinks:** Exclusive cosmetics/animation sets, account-wide vanity, **season pass ultimate tier** (if used).
  - **Conversion:** **TBD** — Option A: non-convertible; Option B: one-way **[PREMIUM_PLUS] → [PREMIUM]** at fixed rate (e.g., 1 → 100). No reverse conversion.

- **Ticket (Used to recruit new Drakes)**
  - **Sources:** Rare Milestones, limited events, season pass
  - **Sinks:** New Drakes, recruiting a drake you already own gives Progress toward upgrading that specific drake's starting stats.
  - **Conversion:** Once a Drake is fully upgraded, chances of recruiting are greatly reduced but not 0%, recruiting a fully upgraded Drake results in large amount of feed.

> **No Soft↔Premium exchange** to protect economy. Limited **Premium→Soft** (or none) — **TBD**; default = **none**.

## 2) Match Rewards (baseline, tune later)

- Per match, award a bundle; values scale by MMR, league, and result:
+ Each match yields rewards that are credited **at career end** and carried into the meta layer. 
+ No rewards are spent inside a career; they only apply to facility upgrades, cosmetics, and account progression between careers.

| Mode          | Win [COINS] | Loss [COINS] | Bonus (chance)              |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| 1v1           | 100         | 40           | +1–3 Feed Fragments (5%)    |
| Tag-Team 2v2  | 180         | 70           | +1–3 Feed Fragments (7%)    |
| 3v3           | 220         | 90           | +2–4 Feed Fragments (10%)   |
| Free-for-All  | 200         | 60           | “Chaos” cosmetic drop (1%)  |
| Gladiator     | 160         | 60           | Gladiator ticket (2%)       |
| Dodgeball 5v5 | 180         | 70           | Style emote (2%)            |

> Numbers are placeholders. Keep **loss payouts** meaningful to avoid quit meta.

## 3) Retirement → **Breed** or **Feed**

At the end of a drake’s career, you make a permanent decision:
- **Breed** (new egg inherits traits)
- **Feed** (convert to Feed currency)

> Note: This choice, like Coins, only affects the **meta layer**. Career runs never involve currency spending.

  - **Yield (example):** `BaseFeed = tier * (level + rarityMod)`  
    - Tier: 1–5; RarityMod: Common=0, Rare=+2, Epic=+5, etc.  
    - Example: Tier-3, Lvl-25 Rare → 3 * (25 + 2) = 81 Feed.

- **Feed Sinks (examples):**
  - Training Efficiency Tier I–V (account-wide): 250/500/900/1500/2400 Feed
  - Facility Unlocks (Gym, Arena variants): 300–1200 Feed
  - Breeding Boost (one egg): +10% favorable trait odds (cap 1 per egg): 150 Feed

---

## 4) Quests & Milestones

- **Dailies:** Small [COINS] + tiny Feed fragment chance; streak = small **[PREMIUM]** drip (weekly).
- **Weeklies:** Larger [COINS], guaranteed Feed; rare cosmetic roll.
- **Season Milestones:** Free track: cosmetics + [COINS]; Premium track: extra cosmetics, animations, profile flair.
- **Events:** Time-boxed modes with themed cosmetics (shop rotates, see §5).

---

## 5) Shops

- **Soft Shop:** Training passes, facility parts, consumables (no stat boosts beyond what training already does).
- **Feed Forge:** Permanent upgrades + breeding boost tokens (non-stacking).
- **Premium Boutique:** Cosmetics, slots, rename, intros/outros.
- **Event Shop:** Limited-time cosmetics purchasable via **event tokens** (earnable by play; optional **[PREMIUM]** top-ups).

**Rotation cadence:** 48–72h for cosmetics; weekly for bundles. Clear “Next rotation in …” timer.

## 6) Monetization Integrity (toggles)

Choose policy and lock it in:

- **A. Cosmetics-Only (strict):** Premium only buys looks + QoL (slots, renames, replays).  
- **B. Time Accelerator (lenient):** Premium can **speed up** training timers (e.g., x2 training ticket) but **never** changes the fight sim math.  
- **C. Competitive Walls (not recommended):** Premium gates systems that directly affect match outcomes. **Avoid** to keep fair matchmaking.

**Default:** **A** or **B**. Document final choice here.

---

## 7) Anti-Abuse & Limits

- Daily cap on quest earnings.  
- No trading currencies between accounts.  
- All currency mutations are **server-authoritative** with a **ledger** (see `docs/51-currency-ledger-and-balance.md`).  
- Refund safety: rolling migration script if we retune exchange rates.

---

## 8) Analytics Hooks (minimal)

- Track per-mode earn/spend, quest completion rates, retention vs purchases, premium sink uptake.  
- Early can be client-batched JSON; server finalizes.

## 9) Tuning Table (TBD)
